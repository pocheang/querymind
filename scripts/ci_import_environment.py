"""Run the suite with the packages CI does not install made unimportable.

A development machine accumulates optional packages -- pytesseract, pdfplumber,
sentence-transformers -- that `requirements/ci.txt` does not contain, and a test
that touches one inherits it silently. `test_present_tesseract_is_active` did
exactly that: it patched `shutil.which` to simulate the binary being present,
while `_ocr` imports pytesseract *first*, so the assertion only held on a machine
that happened to have the package. Green locally, red in CI, and only visible
after a push.

Blocking happens at the `sys.meta_path` finder, not by replacing `__import__`.
That distinction matters: a genuinely absent package is still satisfied from
`sys.modules`, so a test that injects a fake there must keep working. The first
version of this replaced `__import__` and reported a failure in
`test_a_missing_model_never_reaches_the_network` that CI does not have -- a
simulation that is stricter than the thing it simulates sends you to fix code
that is not broken.

The blocked set is checked against `requirements/ci.txt` by
`tests/core/test_ci_import_environment.py`, so an entry that CI actually installs
fails rather than quietly over-restricting the run.
