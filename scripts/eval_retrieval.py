"""Print retrieval quality over the evaluation corpus.

    python scripts/eval_retrieval.py            # BM25, no model needed
    python scripts/eval_retrieval.py --vector   # adds vector + hybrid, needs BGE-M3

The BM25 form is the one `tests/evaluation/test_retrieval_metric.py` asserts on,
and it runs anywhere: `read_corpus_records` reads a plain JSONL file, so there is
no embedding model, no Chroma, no Neo4j and no LLM involved.

`--vector` is deliberately **not** in CI. `_load_cross_encoder` is built with
`local_files_only=True`, so on a machine without the reranker downloaded it
returns None and retrieval silently degrades to `lexical_rerank` -- a CI job
would publish a number measuring the lexical fallback rather than the reranker,
which is worse than publishing nothing. It also needs a populated (gitignored)
Chroma directory. Same reasoning as `npm run screenshots`: a local before/after
tool, not a gate.

Point it at your own corpus by placing `data/eval/retrieval_corpus.jsonl` and
`data/eval/retrieval_queries.json`; those win over the tracked defaults.
