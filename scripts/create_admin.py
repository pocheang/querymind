"""Create (or reset) the local development administrator.

    conda run -n rag-local python scripts/create_admin.py

The account is a **development fixture**, not a deployment step. It exists so the
admin surface can be opened and looked at on a checkout: before this there was no
account with the `admin` role at all, so `/admin/config/schema`, the ops pages and
the user management screens could not be exercised by anyone.

The password comes from `ADMIN_PASSWORD` when it is set, and is otherwise
generated and printed **once**. It is never written to a file in the repository,
because a credential in version control is a credential in everyone's checkout —
and a fixture password has a way of reaching a server that is not a fixture.

Idempotent: an existing account is left alone unless `--reset-password` is given,
so re-running this after a database reset is safe and re-running it by accident
costs nothing.

Policy (`app/services/auth/validation.py`): at least 12 characters, with
lowercase, uppercase, a digit and one of `!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>?`.
