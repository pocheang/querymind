"""List the locked packages that publish no wheel for the target platform.

`--only-binary :all:` refuses source distributions, which is what keeps a
`setup.py` from running during an install. A package that publishes no wheel at
all therefore cannot be installed under it and has to be named in
`--no-binary`, one exemption at a time.

Finding those one at a time is what this exists to stop. Two of them broke CI on
consecutive pushes -- jieba first, then forbiddenfruit (a dependency of
blockbuster) -- each discovered only by a red build, because the failure is a
property of PyPI rather than of anything in the repository. Asking PyPI for the
whole lock at once takes about twenty seconds.

Run it after `make lock`; `make lock` does. It queries PyPI, so it is not part of
the test suite: a unit test that needs the network fails on a train.

    python scripts/check_lock_wheels.py

It takes no arguments on purpose. The two locks are the only thing it has to
read, and a path off the command line is a path this script would then open --
which is what `pythonsecurity:S8707` said about its first version, correctly.
