"""Refuse to let anything sensitive reach GitHub, or a delivery copy.

Two modes, because they are two different jobs:

    python scripts/check_sensitive.py                  every tracked file (CI)
    python scripts/check_sensitive.py FILE...          just these (pre-commit)
    python scripts/check_sensitive.py --tree DIR       a delivery copy on disk

The first two read the file list from git, which is the whole point: a working
tree legitimately contains data/, logs/, .venv/ and node_modules/, all of them
gitignored. Walking the filesystem there would fail on every run. Asking git
instead turns FORBIDDEN_PATHS into a check that means something -- it catches a
`git add -f data/app.db`, which is how a database actually reaches a repository.

--tree is the delivery-copy check, where the filesystem *is* the artifact and a
gitignored directory being present means the copy was made by hand rather than
by `git clone`, or was contaminated afterwards. Running a build inside the copy
is enough to do that: ruff leaves .ruff_cache/, and importing app/ creates data/.

The two baselines below are ratchets, the same shape as KNOWN_OFFENDERS in
tests/security/ and scripts/design-scale-baseline.json: what exists today is
frozen and may shrink, anything new fails. A blanket directory allowlist was the
alternative and it was worse -- exempting all of docs/ would let a real key land
in any document in the project.
