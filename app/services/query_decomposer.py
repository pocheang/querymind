- For comparison queries, create separate queries for each item and a comparison query
- For sequential queries, break down into logical steps
- For parallel queries, separate into independent aspects
- Limit to maximum 4 sub-queries
- Each sub-query should be self-contained and answerable independently
- Output in Chinese if the query is in Chinese
