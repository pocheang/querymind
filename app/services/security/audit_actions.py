"""The audit log's vocabulary, in one place.

These names are written at some seventy call sites across ``app/api`` and read
back by string comparison in two other places: the operations counters in
``app/services/runtime/runtime_ops.py`` and the admin console's action filter.
Three lists that had to agree with nothing checking that they did -- and unlike
the permission vocabulary next door, a divergence here fails *silently*: a
counter that matches no row reports zero and a filter that matches no row
reports "no results", neither of which looks like a defect to anyone.

``StrEnum``, so members are strings and no call site changes behaviour.  What
changes is that a name that does not exist is an ``AttributeError`` at import
rather than a metric that quietly reads nothing.
