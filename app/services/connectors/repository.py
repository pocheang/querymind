"""Encrypted connector credentials, persisted to the application database.

Held in a process-local dict until 2026-08-30. A restart threw the secrets away
while `connector_metadata` still pointed at them, so a connector could survive
its own credential and every call through it would fail an owner check it could
never pass again.

The stored value is ciphertext -- `ConnectorCredentialService` encrypts before
handing a record here and this class has no plaintext accessor -- so persisting
it does not widen what a database read exposes. It does mean the encryption key
now has to outlive the process too: with `API_SETTINGS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` rotated
or regenerated, stored credentials become undecryptable rather than merely
absent.
