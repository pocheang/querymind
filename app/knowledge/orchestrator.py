        Concurrency is the default because sources are independent. A source that
        declares otherwise (`PriorEvidenceAdapter.wants_prior_evidence`) gets a
        second phase, and pays for it: its duration lands on the critical path
        instead of overlapping the others. So the second phase exists only when an
        adapter says it would use it -- with `GRAPH_RAG_ENHANCED` off, everything
        is still one `gather` and retrieval latency is unchanged.

        Phase two inherits what is *left* of the retrieval stage rather than a
        fresh copy of each plan's timeout. Otherwise two phases could take
        `phase_one + phase_two` and blow through `STAGE_TIMEOUT_RETRIEVAL_MS`,
        turning a sharper graph lookup into a degraded stage -- a strictly worse
        trade than the plain lookup it replaced.

        Order is restored by *index*, not by source name: `sources` carries no
        uniqueness constraint, so keying the reassembly on the source would quietly
        collapse two plans for one source into one outcome. Downstream,
