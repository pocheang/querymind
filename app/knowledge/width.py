"""How wide a retrieval should be, given the query and the plan.

This is retrieval *planning*, so it lives next to the Knowledge Agent rather
than inside a retriever: the Agent decides the shape of a search and the
orchestrator executes it. `app/retrievers/hybrid/` still re-exports
`adaptive_retrieval_params` under its old name for the legacy hybrid path.

The complexity signal is deliberately one definition with two call sites. The
hybrid retriever scales `VECTOR_TOP_K`/`BM25_TOP_K` (6); the Knowledge Agent
scales `TOP_K` (4). Same formula, different bases, so neither path silently
inherits the other's default width.
