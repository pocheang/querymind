    Two things are separable here and were previously confused.  The *enhanced

    lookup whose source documents are too poor to have produced a trustworthy
    graph -- are estimated from the documents, which only exist after the other
    sources have run.

    So this adapter asks for a second phase only when enhanced mode is on.  With
    `GRAPH_RAG_ENHANCED` off, the prior evidence has no reader and the adapter
    stays in phase one, where graph retrieval overlaps everything else exactly as
    before.

    **Prior evidence tunes; it never widens.** What crosses into
    `run_graph_rag` is a quality *score* over the retrieved text plus its page
    and format metadata; `run_graph_rag_with_pdf_context` does not read entities
    out of the documents to query with, and `allowed_sources`/`owner` are still
    the caller's, resolved by `privacy_permission`.  A document that argues for
    its own importance can therefore buy itself a larger `max_neighbors` and
    nothing else.  Keep it that way: letting document text choose which entities
    to look up would make retrieved content steer retrieval, and the answer to
    "who wrote this document" is not always "the person asking".
