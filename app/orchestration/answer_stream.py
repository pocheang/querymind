"""Execution-scoped store for redacted answer fragments.

Mirrors `execution_events.ExecutionEventStore`: the synthesizer writes, the SSE
endpoint reads, and the two can only meet on a process-wide instance because the
RAG pipeline has no access to `app.state`.

Everything written here has already been through `StreamingRedactor`, which
emits only text whose redaction cannot still change. Nothing else may write to
this store -- an unredacted fragment reaching it is the same disclosure that
`output_filter` exists to prevent, just earlier.

The fragments are a *draft*. They carry no citation numbering and no reference
list: those are decided in `output_filter`, after the whole answer exists and
after DLP has settled which citations survive. The client shows the draft while
it is being written and replaces it with the final answer from the query
response.
