"""The process-wide governed tool stack.

Two callers need to meet on the *same* objects and previously did not: the API
layer (``app/api/deps/runtime.py``) built its own registry, approvals and
gateway, and the RAG pipeline had none at all. Sharing them is not a
performance question, it is a correctness one -- ``ToolRegistry`` hands out an
approval token from one ``ApprovalStore`` and ``POST
/api/v1/connectors/approvals/{token}`` looks it up in another, so a token minted
on one path could never be redeemed on the other.

Mirrors ``app/orchestration/execution_events.get_default_execution_event_store``:
the pipeline has no access to ``app.state``, so a process-wide instance is the
only place the two sides can meet.

Built lazily. Construction needs ``API_SETTINGS_ENCRYPTION_KEY``, and
``CoreCapabilities()`` is constructed in tests and scripts that have no reason
to hold connector credentials; deferring to first tool use keeps that working.
