    second is the worse one:

    * A word jieba splits entirely into single characters disappears from the
      query and from the document alike, so it can never match. Measured on
      30 realistic domain terms only one behaved this way -- but it is a silent
      total failure, and which words fall in that set is unpredictable.

    * More common: jieba emits a *sub-word* and the sub-word is then used as if
      it were the word. `陪产假` (paternity leave) tokenizes to exactly `产假`
      (maternity leave) -- an identical token set, so BM25 could not tell the two
      apart at all, and a query about one ranked the other first. That is a wrong
      answer, not a missing one.

    Bigrams fix both without a dictionary: `年假` is recovered from the two
    characters jieba split it into, and `陪产` distinguishes `陪产假` from `产假`.
    They are added alongside jieba's tokens rather than replacing them, so known
    words keep their exact-match weight; BM25's IDF discounts the bigrams that
    turn out to be common.
