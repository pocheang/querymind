"""Read and change the running configuration from the console.

Before this, an administrator could reload configuration but not write it: the
reload endpoint re-read a file no HTTP path could produce, so from a browser it
did nothing unless somebody had already edited the file on the host. These two
endpoints close that half of the loop.

The write goes to the configuration centre, never to the rendered runtime file.
The centre owns version history and rollback; writing the file instead would mean
reimplementing both, badly, and would leave two writers for one document.
