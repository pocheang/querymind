"""Rate limiting middleware for sensitive endpoints.

Backed by Redis where one is configured, and by an in-process window otherwise.

Rules match on method and path *pattern*, not on an exact path. They used to be
exact, which was enough while the only protected routes were `/auth/login` and
its two siblings -- and was why the admin routes could not be added here, since
every one of them carries a `{user_id}`.

That mattered because the admin routes believed they were rate limited. Eight of
them carried `@limiter.limit(...)` from a slowapi wrapper in
`app/services/security/admin_rate_limit.py`, and slowapi was never a dependency
of this project: not in pyproject, not in the locks, not installed. So
`SLOWAPI_AVAILABLE` was always False, the wrapper always returned a no-op
decorator, and creating an administrator, resetting a password and resetting an
approval token were all unlimited. Nor was a limiter ever registered on the app,
so installing slowapi would not have fixed it either. That module is gone and
its limits are rules here, where the middleware that runs them is registered.
