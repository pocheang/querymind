"""One definition of "the configuration was reloaded".

Two things now trigger a reload -- the admin endpoint and a push from the
configuration centre -- and they must do the same work. A watcher that dropped
its own subset of the caches would be a second, quieter definition, and the
difference would only ever show up as "the value took effect when I clicked the
button but not when I saved it in the console".

Living in the API layer rather than under `app/services/` is deliberate: the
sequence has to touch `api_dependencies`, and a service importing the API layer
would invert the dependency.
