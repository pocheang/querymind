"""What an administrator may change from a console, and where each value came from.

Two decisions are recorded here, and both are deliberate.

**The editable set is a central allowlist, not an annotation on each field.**
`Settings` has 236 fields; annotating them individually would scatter a
security-relevant decision across 236 lines, and the question an operator or a
reviewer actually asks -- "what can someone with console access change?" -- would
have no single place to answer it. It is opt-in: a new field is not editable
until it is named here, which is the safe direction to fail.

**"Which layer did this value come from" is part of the schema.** It is the
question a configuration page exists to answer, and the one nothing in this
system could answer before: a value set in the process environment outranks the
console, so an administrator who changes something there and sees no effect needs
to be told *why*, not left to guess. The order mirrors
`Settings.settings_customise_sources` exactly.

`requires_restart` is honest rather than aspirational. Almost everything here is
hot because `RAGPipeline` and its services are built per request and
`apply_config_reload()` rebuilds the query runtime; the exceptions are values
read once into a module constant or captured by a long-lived object, and the
guard on that is `tests/core/test_config_has_one_source.py`, which keeps the
legacy constant block from growing. Nothing in that block is exposed here.
