"""A configuration centre as a settings source, not as a fourth layer.

`Settings` stays the single schema: types, defaults, aliases and validation all
live there, and this module only supplies values for it to validate. The
alternative -- fetching the remote configuration at startup and writing it into
`os.environ` -- was rejected twice over: it destroys the "a deployment can pin a
value the configuration centre cannot move" semantics that `MODEL_BACKEND=local`
already relies on, and it smuggles values past `Settings`'s own validation.

Precedence is therefore declared once, by the source order in
`Settings.settings_customise_sources`:

    init > real process environment > remote configuration > .runtime/*.env > defaults

**Nothing here may block or break startup.** A configuration centre is an
external dependency on the path to `get_settings()`, which is on the path to
everything. Three levels of degradation, in order: the remote value, the local
snapshot written by the last successful fetch, and finally nothing at all --
which simply leaves the lower sources (`.runtime/*.env`, then field defaults) in
charge. Every failure is logged and swallowed.

**A source must return values keyed by field *alias*.** `{"ENABLE_CALIBRATION":
True}` is applied; `{"enable_calibration": True}` is silently ignored, because
`Settings` validates by alias and `extra="ignore"` drops the rest. Silently is
the operative word -- there is no error to notice -- so
`tests/core/test_remote_config_source.py` pins it. Aliases are also what
`config/env/*` and the rendered runtime file already use, so one name follows a
value from the repository to the console.

Bootstrap (`NACOS_*`) is read from the real environment and is deliberately not
in `Settings`: it configures the thing that supplies `Settings`, the same
chicken-and-egg that keeps `APP_ENV` and `RUNTIME_ENV_FILE` out of it.
