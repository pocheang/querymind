"""Measure retrieval quality on a corpus that ships with the repository.

Why this exists at all: CLAUDE.md has claimed P@5 > 0.85 for a long time and
nothing measured it. `POST /api/evaluation/run` reads `data/evaluation/*.json`,
and `data/` is gitignored -- so on every checkout where nobody hand-placed a file
the endpoint returned 404. A target with no measurement behind it is a number,
not a claim.

Two decisions worth knowing before changing this module.

**It runs through `KnowledgeOrchestrator`, not through the evaluation
baselines.** The baselines in `app/evaluation/baselines/api_retriever.py` call
`similarity_search` and `hybrid_search_with_diagnostics` directly: they never
touch the orchestrator, the adapters, or `reciprocal_rank_fuse`, so they cannot
observe a change to any of them. Going through the orchestrator costs one more
import and measures the path the chat request actually takes -- including
`_flatten`, RRF, deduplication and `mask_evidence`.

**BM25 only, so it needs no model.** `read_corpus_records` reads a plain JSONL
file at `corpus_store_path`; nothing here needs an embedding model, Chroma,
Neo4j or an LLM, which is what lets it run in CI and on a fresh checkout. The
vector and hybrid paths deliberately stay manual: `_load_cross_encoder` is built
with `local_files_only=True`, so a CI run without the model downloaded would
silently fall back to `lexical_rerank` and publish a number measuring the
fallback rather than the reranker. A green metric measuring the wrong thing is
worse than no metric.
