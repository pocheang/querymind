"""Sentence-level entailment checking for the validation cascade.

Until 2026-09-04 this stage had never run. It was gated by `CASCADE_ENABLE_LEVEL2`
-- `CascadeLevel.NLI_BATCH` being level 2 -- which defaulted to False, while
CLAUDE.md listed NLI among the checks answer validation performs. The switch is
`CASCADE_ENABLE_NLI` now, named for the stage it gates rather than a position,
because the numbering was itself wrong: level 3 gated the citation check, so
reading the configuration told you the opposite of what ran.

Turning it on as it stood would have been worse than leaving it off, for three
independent reasons, all fixed here:

* **It blocked the event loop.** `model.predict(...)` -- a synchronous
  cross-encoder forward pass -- was called directly inside `async def`, with no
  `asyncio.to_thread`, no timeout and no circuit breaker. `get_model()` loaded the
  model on the loop too, and without `local_files_only=True`, so a machine that
  had never downloaded it would have started an untimed network download inside a
  request.

* **The deterministic fallback could not score Chinese.** It tokenised with
  `re.findall(r"\\w+", ...)`, and `\\w` matches CJK, so a whole Chinese clause
  became *one* token. Measured on realistic pairs: a verbatim clause copy scored
  1.00, but a paraphrase, a recombination of two sources, and a sentence with an
  added connective all scored **0.00**. Synthesis paraphrases and recombines by
  construction, so three of four realistic shapes were counted unsupported --
  which the verifier turns into `factuality < 0.7` and then a rejected answer.

* **The model is English.** `NLI_MODEL_NAME` defaults to an English
  cross-encoder, and the code reads `scores[:, 2]` as its entailment column,
  which is model-specific. On Chinese pairs its output is noise, so the
  cross-encoder now runs only on predominantly-Latin text and everything else
  takes the (repaired) deterministic path. Which one ran is reported rather than
  assumed -- see `CascadeResult.backend`.
