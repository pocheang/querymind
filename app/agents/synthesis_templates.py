CONCEPT_TEMPLATE = """
Answer template for concept explanation:

1. Core definition with citation [doc_id:page]
2. Key characteristics (each with citation)
3. Scope and boundaries (cite sources or acknowledge limitation)

Citation rules:
- EVERY factual claim MUST have [doc_id:page] citation
- If information is not in context, explicitly state "根据提供的信息" (based on provided information)
- Use hedging language for uncertain or incomplete contexts: "部分应用包括..." (some applications include...)

Example structure:
<concept> 是 <definition> [doc1:p3]。它的主要特征包括：<feature1> [doc1:p5]，<feature2> [doc2:p1]。
"""

COMPARISON_TEMPLATE = """
Answer template for comparison questions:

1. Brief introduction of both subjects with citations
2. Structured comparison table or point-by-point analysis:
   - Dimension 1: Subject A [doc_id:page] vs Subject B [doc_id:page]
   - Dimension 2: Subject A [doc_id:page] vs Subject B [doc_id:page]
3. Summary of key differences with citations

Citation rules:
- Each comparison dimension MUST cite sources for BOTH subjects
- If one subject lacks context, explicitly state: "提供的信息中未包含<subject>的<aspect>" (provided information does not include...)
- Avoid subjective preference without citation

Example structure:
对比 <A> 和 <B>：
- 特征维度：<A>使用<method1> [doc1:p2]，而<B>采用<method2> [doc2:p5]
- 应用场景：<A>适用于<scenario1> [doc1:p8]，<B>用于<scenario2> [doc3:p1]
"""

RELATIONSHIP_TEMPLATE = """
Answer template for relationship questions (how X relates to Y):

1. Establish context for both entities with citations
2. Direct relationship with citation [doc_id:page]
3. Supporting evidence or examples (each cited)
4. Scope limitation if context is incomplete

Citation rules:
- Direct relationship claim MUST have citation
- Supporting examples must cite sources
- If relationship is inferred, use hedging: "根据提供的信息，X和Y可能存在关联" (based on provided information, X and Y may be related)

Example structure:
<X> 与 <Y> 的关系：<X> 是 <Y> 的 <relationship> [doc1:p3]。具体表现为：<evidence1> [doc1:p4]，<evidence2> [doc2:p2]。
"""

PROCEDURAL_TEMPLATE = """
Answer template for procedural/how-to questions:

1. Overview of the process with citation
2. Step-by-step breakdown (each step cited):
   Step 1: <action> [doc_id:page]
   Step 2: <action> [doc_id:page]
   ...
3. Important notes or prerequisites (cited)

Citation rules:
- Each step MUST have supporting citation
- If steps are missing from context, explicitly state: "提供的信息中包含部分步骤" (provided information contains partial steps)
- Do not fabricate steps not in context

Example structure:
<process> 的步骤：
1. <step1> [doc1:p5]
2. <step2> [doc1:p6]
3. <step3> [doc2:p2]
注意：<prerequisite> [doc1:p4]
"""

GENERAL_TEMPLATE = """
Answer template for general questions:

1. Direct answer to the question with citation [doc_id:page]
2. Supporting details (each with citation)
3. Context or qualifications if needed (cited)

Citation rules:
- EVERY factual claim MUST have [doc_id:page] citation
- No citation = no claim (use hedging or acknowledge limitation)
- For broad questions with narrow context, scope the answer: "根据提供的信息，<scoped_answer>"

Example structure:
<question_restatement>：<answer> [doc1:p3]。<detail1> [doc1:p5]，<detail2> [doc2:p1]。

Before generating the answer, think through:

1. Query Analysis:
   - What is the user really asking?
   - What type of query is this (concept/comparison/relationship/procedural)?
   - What would be a complete answer?

2. Context Assessment:
   - What factual claims can I make from the provided context?
   - What citations support each claim?
   - What information is missing?

3. Citation Planning:
   - Which doc_id:page supports each factual statement?
   - Are there unsupported claims I should remove or hedge?
   - Do I need to acknowledge information gaps?

4. Answer Structure:
   - How should I organize the answer (definition, comparison, steps, etc.)?
   - Where do citations fit naturally?
   - What hedging language is needed for uncertain areas?

Then generate the answer following the template for the query type.

Hedging Language Guidelines (for uncertain or incomplete contexts):

Chinese hedging phrases:
- "根据提供的信息" (based on provided information)
- "部分<noun>包括" (some <noun> include)
- "可能" (may/might) - use sparingly and with context
- "一般来说" (generally speaking)
- "在某些情况下" (in some cases)
- "提供的信息中提到" (the provided information mentions)
- "有限的信息显示" (limited information shows)

English hedging phrases:
- "based on the provided information"
- "some examples include"
- "may" or "might" - use sparingly and with context
- "generally"
- "in some cases"
- "according to the available context"
- "limited information suggests"

When to hedge:
- Broad questions with narrow context (e.g., "all applications" when context lists 2)
- Inferences not directly stated in context
- Partial information about a topic
- When connecting information across documents without explicit link

When NOT to hedge:
- Direct facts from context with clear citations
- Well-supported claims with multiple citations
- Don't over-hedge to the point of being unhelpful
