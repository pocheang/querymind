"""Choose at most one governed tool from what the *user* asked for.

## Why this function cannot see retrieved documents

Until now tool intent was a regex over the question, so a document containing
"disable connector payroll" could not trigger anything. The system was safe --
but safe by accident, because nobody had wired a model into the decision.

Letting a model choose the tool is what makes the tool surface extensible, and
it is also what would put this system in the middle of the lethal trifecta:
private data, attacker-controllable content, and an action that reaches outside.
Retrieved chunks are attacker-controllable the moment one user can put a
document where another user's query will retrieve it -- which is the entire
point of a shared corpus.

So the accident is made a design property here: **the selector's inputs are the
user's own words and nothing else.** It takes a question, the conversation, and
the tool catalogue. It does not take an ``EvidenceBundle``, a ``ContextBundle``,
or anything derived from one, and ``ToolRunner`` no longer receives evidence
either, so there is no argument to pass even by mistake.
``tests/security/test_tool_selection_is_evidence_blind.py`` pins both.

If a tool ever genuinely needs retrieved content, that is a deliberate change
with its own threat model -- not a parameter someone adds in passing.

## Why observations are filtered

Multi-step selection feeds earlier tool results back in, which reopens the same
question one layer down: a tool that reaches outside returns text somebody else
wrote. `ToolRisk` already had the word for this -- ``open_world`` -- so an
open-world tool contributes only its id and status to the next decision, never
its text. A tool whose summary its own code composes (every tool registered
today) contributes the summary.
