"""Router decision caching.

Cache versioning: the router cache key includes a version so calibration changes
invalidate it.

This module used to also expose `cached_vector_search`, plus a synthesis cache
and cache stats/clear helpers. All were unreachable, and `cached_vector_search`
was actively dangerous: it built its key from `kwargs.get("allowed_sources")`, so
applying it to a caller that passed `allowed_sources` positionally would have
dropped the isolation dimension from the key and served one user's retrieval
results to another. Removed 2026-08-30 with phase 2 of
docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-29-user-data-isolation.md.

The store is a plain synchronous TTL/LRU. It used to be the async
`LRUMemoryCache`, driven from this synchronous decorator with
`loop.run_until_complete` -- and `decide_route` runs inside `asyncio.to_thread`,
where there is no event loop, so every worker thread created one with
`new_event_loop()` and never closed it. A route decision is an in-memory
dictionary lookup; it never needed a loop.

    Decorator to cache router decisions.

    Cache key includes: question, agent_class_hint, use_reasoning, use_llm_intent,

    The key deliberately carries no user identity: a route decision is an intent
    classification over the question text and holds no document content, so it is
    the same answer for every caller. Anything that caches *retrieval results*
    must key on the access scope instead -- see
    app/retrievers/hybrid/caching.py.
