/**
 * This reducer used to live in `features/tool-approval/state.ts` and carry the
 * pending approval, which inverted the dependency (the trace panel imported its
 * own state from the approval feature) and gave the app two sources of truth for
 * a pending approval: the SSE event and the query response.
 *
 * Only the response path knows the question, and resuming means re-sending that
 * question with the approved token -- so the response is the source of truth and
 * this reducer is back to owning only what it is named for.
