/**
 * Confirming an approval re-sends the question that produced it. The question
 * and the approval therefore have to travel together.
 *
 * They did not at first: ChatPage tracked the question in a ref that each `ask`
 * call site had to remember to set, and one of the three -- the
 * clarification-complete path -- did not. A confirmation after a clarified
 * query would have re-sent a stale question, executing the approved action
 * against text the user never asked about in that turn.
 *
 * The pairing now comes out of the run itself (`onPendingApproval(approval,
 * question)`), which is what these tests pin: given a result, what the caller
 * should hold.
