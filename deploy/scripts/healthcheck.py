"""Wait for the backend's health endpoint, from inside its own container.

Nothing about the target is configurable, and that is the whole design. It ran
as `--url <anything>` handed straight to `urlopen`, which is
`pythonsecurity:S8703`: a URL off the command line reaching an HTTP client is an
SSRF primitive, and `urlopen` speaks `file://` too -- a health check that would
have reported /etc/passwd as healthy.

Two narrower versions did not settle it, and the reason is worth keeping. First
a scheme check, which returns its argument unchanged and so leaves the caller
holding the host -- the half that decides where the request goes. Then `--port`
as a bounded int with the host as a literal, which is genuinely un-exploitable
but still traces argv into `urlopen`, and a taint analysis is right not to try to
prove otherwise from a range check.

So the target comes from nowhere the caller controls. The port is the one the
image's own CMD serves on and EXPOSE publishes; a health check that can be
pointed at a different port than the container runs is not a more useful tool,
it is a less accurate one. `--timeout` and `--interval` stay: they are floats
that never touch the URL.
