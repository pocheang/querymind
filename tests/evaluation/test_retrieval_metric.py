"""A retrieval metric that runs on a fresh checkout, and can fail.

CLAUDE.md has claimed P@5 > 0.85 for a long time with nothing measuring it: the
one endpoint that could reads `data/evaluation/*.json`, `data/` is gitignored, so
on every checkout where nobody hand-placed a file it returned 404. This suite
ships a corpus and a query set instead, and measures them through the real
`KnowledgeOrchestrator`.

The most important test here is `test_a_mismatched_scope_returns_nothing`.
`mask_evidence` runs inside `_retrieve_source`, so a corpus whose ownership
metadata does not match the scope drops every item and scores 0.00 for a reason
that has nothing to do with retrieval quality -- indistinguishable from a broken
retriever. Proving the metric can fail is the precondition for trusting it when
it passes, the same lesson as the sensitive-content gate.

Scores are pinned exactly rather than ratcheted on an aggregate: BM25 over a
fixed JSONL file is deterministic, and with twelve queries an aggregate moves in
jumps of about 0.08, so a ratchet on it would either never fire or fire on a
corpus edit. Per-query reciprocal ranks name the offender instead.
