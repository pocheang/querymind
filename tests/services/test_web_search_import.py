"""`ddgs` must be fully imported before any request can reach it.

`from ddgs import DDGS` does not import ddgs. The name is a proxy whose metaclass
runs `importlib.import_module` on the first *call*, holding its own lock while it
does -- and the module it imports calls `logging.getLogger` on the way in.

One query starts several web searches, each on its own worker thread, so those
are several concurrent first calls. Reproduced on Windows: three worker threads
inside `ddgs/__init__.py::_load_real`, one parked in `logging.getLogger`. What
turned a slow start into a dead process is that the stuck thread holds the
logging lock, so every later log call blocks -- including uvicorn's per-request
access log. `/health` and `/openapi.json` stopped answering while the event loop
itself sat idle and healthy, which is why this reads as a hang with no CPU rather
than as a slow search.

The `timeout=10` at the call site never applied: it bounds the HTTP request, not
the import.

So the property is not "web search works" -- it is "there is no first-call import
left to race". These tests assert that, and that concurrent construction from
several threads completes.
