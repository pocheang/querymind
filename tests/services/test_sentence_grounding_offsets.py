"""A hedge must land between sentences, not inside a word.

`apply_sentence_grounding` scores each sentence against the evidence and splices
a hedge in front of the weak ones. It splices **by offset** into the raw answer,
and the offsets come from `_sentence_spans`, which computes them against a
*protected* copy where dots that are not sentence boundaries have been
substituted out.

Two defects made those offsets wrong, and the second one made them wrong often.

The sentinel was `"<ABBR>"` -- six characters replacing one -- beside a comment
asserting that "protection never shifts a position". Every dot protected in a
sentence pushed everything after it five characters to the right.

And the abbreviations were matched as bare substrings, so `"p."` matched inside
"setup.", `"ed."` inside "used." / "based." / "updated." / "required.", and
`"no."` inside "casino.". Those are ordinary English sentence endings, so a
protection intended for "Dr." and "e.g." fired on a large share of English
answers. The same loop tried only `abbr` and `abbr.upper()`, so the ordinary
capitalisation -- "Dr." -- was the one form it did *not* protect.

Measured on the answer below, the hedge landed five characters into the final
sentence:

    'Access is based. The retention window is ninety days. Backups run nightly.'
    'Access is based. The retention window is ninety days. Backu基于当前可用证据，Backups run nightly.'

This reached the reader: `apply_sentence_grounding` runs from
`app/agents/finalizer/service.py` on the live answer path. It is the failure
CLAUDE.md already described for URLs -- "the hedge spliced into the middle of the
link, which breaks the citation the sentence was carrying" -- happening to
ordinary prose, because the same substitution was doing it.
