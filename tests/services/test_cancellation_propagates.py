"""A cancelled task must end cancelled.

`_cleanup_loop` caught `asyncio.CancelledError` and `break`, so the coroutine
finished *normally*. `await task` after `task.cancel()` then returned without
raising, and nothing downstream could distinguish "stopped when asked" from
"finished on its own". The absorbing belongs in `stop_periodic_cleanup`, which
is the caller that asked for the cancellation -- and that one keeps its
`except: pass` deliberately.

This file also held the SessionStore write-truth tests until 2026-09-02. They
went with `app/services/auth/enhanced_session.py`: its only production entry
point was the CSRF middleware, which required a cookie nothing set, so the
module they pinned had no reader on any request path.
