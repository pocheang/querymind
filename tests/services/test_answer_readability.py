Four separate defects, in two files:

`LocalEvidenceChatModel` (app/services/models/runtime.py)
  1. narrated itself ("我对…的回答如下") and closed with a paragraph about
     configuring Ollama;
  2. echoed `ContextBuilder`'s addressing header (`[E1] document=…; layer=…;
     retriever=…`), which is metadata, not prose;
  3. `_extract_section` terminated only on labels ending in `上下文:`, so the last
     section ran to the end of the prompt and swallowed the answer template --
     the model's own instructions came back as part of the answer.

`apply_sentence_grounding` (app/services/retrieval/citation_grounding.py)
  4. treated a bare citation marker as a sentence, scored it unsupported, and
     prefixed it -- hedging the attribution rather than the claim.
