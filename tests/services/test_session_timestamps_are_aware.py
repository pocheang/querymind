"""Session metadata timestamps are aware, whatever the database holds.

`python:S6903` flagged seven `datetime.utcnow()` calls as deprecated. The
deprecation is the least of it: `utcnow()` returns a *naive* datetime, and a
naive one beside an aware one in the same comparison raises

    TypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes

`search.py::_sort_results` sorts SearchResult objects on
`metadata.updated_at`, so that comparison is one `sorted()` away from a 500 on
session search. It had never fired because every writer was consistently naive.

Which is what makes the obvious fix the dangerous one. Switching the writers to
`datetime.now(UTC)` and stopping there would have *created* the mix it was
meant to avoid: rows written before the change parse back naive, rows after come
back aware, and the first search that spans both raises. So the read path
normalises too, and these tests are mostly about that half.
