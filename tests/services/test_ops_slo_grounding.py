"""The grounding SLO measures answers, and reports nothing when it measured none.

It used to average the ratio over *audit* rows with action ``query.run``, which
no call site has ever written -- the three ``query.*`` actions are recorded only
when a query is refused.  The list was therefore always empty, and an average
over zero samples was 1.0, so the operations page reported a perfect grounding
ratio for a metric it had never once observed.  An alert that cannot fire is
worse than an absent one: it reads as evidence that nothing is wrong.

The value now rides the request's own metrics row, the same window the p95 is
computed from.  The first test below covers the plumbing that makes that
possible, which is the part that is easy to get wrong and impossible to see:
``request.state`` survives the hop back up to the middleware, and a ContextVar
would not.
