"""A collection the retriever reads must be written by a class something builds.

`chart` was a retrieval modality for as long as this file's subject existed. It
was selected on visual wording, it queried `chart_descriptions`, and it returned
nothing every time -- because the only thing that writes that collection is
`ChartAnalyzer.index_chart`, and nothing in `app/` ever constructed a
`ChartAnalyzer`. The retriever swallowed the missing collection quietly
("Chart collection not found, skipping"), so the modality cost a retrieval slot
and an INFO line and bought nothing.

Two weaker checks would both have passed. `chart_descriptions` *was* named in
`app/` -- by its producer. `ChartAnalyzer.index_chart` *did* write it correctly.
The broken link is one further out: the class had no caller, so the method had no
caller, so the collection had no writer.

So this walks the chain the defect actually broke:

    collection name in the retriever
      -> the `index_*` method that writes it
        -> the class that method belongs to
          -> a construction of that class somewhere in `app/`

`ChartAnalyzer` was deleted (2026-09-05) rather than connected. The capability
did not go with it: a chart is an image, and `_index_images` captions images
through `app/ingestion/extraction/vision.py`, which follows
`IMAGE_CAPTION_BACKEND` and `MODEL_BACKEND` -- where `ChartAnalyzer` built its own
`AsyncOpenAI` client against a `VISION_MODEL` setting the admin page cannot
reach, outside the egress redaction the model wrapper applies.

    of its methods, so class construction says nothing about any other.

    **This still would not have caught `visual_embeddings`, and it is worth
    saying so rather than implying otherwise.** That collection was written by a
    *branch* of `index_image` -- `if image.visual_embedding:` -- guarded by a
    field only `process_images_batch` ever set, and that method had no caller. So
    the collection was read on every image search, never written, and the read
    raised once per query into an INFO log. Method, class and collection name all
    resolve; the dead link is a branch condition, which no static check here can
    see. It was found by reading the code, and both sides are deleted.

    The chain this does check is still worth checking -- it is what named
