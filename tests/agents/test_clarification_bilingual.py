"""Regression tests for clarification language and non-fatal degradation.

Two defects: the question catalogue was Chinese-only in a system that promises
bilingual support, and the in-pipeline clarification node raised on
``action == "ask"`` — which it always returns there, because the pipeline calls
the clarifier without any collected context.

# `test_clarification_node_does_not_raise_on_ask` stood here. It read the source
# of the pipeline's clarification node to check its `ask` branch degraded rather
# than raising. That node is gone -- it could never do anything, because a graph
# node has no collected context to give the clarifier -- so the property is now
# structural rather than asserted:
# tests/orchestration/test_clarification_is_not_a_pipeline_stage.py.
