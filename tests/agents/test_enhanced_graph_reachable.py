"""`GRAPH_RAG_ENHANCED` has to actually select the enhanced lookup.

`_run_graph_rag_impl` gated the enhanced branch on `should_enhance and
retrieved_docs`. The setting was therefore inert: the one production caller
(`app/knowledge/adapters.py`) reached `run_graph_rag` with no documents, so every
request fell through to `graph_lookup`, and all 495 lines of
`app/agents/rag/enhanced_graph.py` were dead code that the module graph
nonetheless said was reachable.

Documents are a *refinement* of that branch, not its precondition: they feed the
quality estimate that picks the result limits, and the estimate has a defined
neutral value without them.
