"""Three loops that were built with one end missing.

Each was reachable, documented, and switchable -- and each did nothing when
switched on, because the half that feeds it was never connected:

* clarification advanced a round only when the *session store* recorded an
  answer, so a caller that asked again without answering got the same question
  back forever and the round cap could not be reached;
* fact verification rebuilt its source documents by regexing a context format
  retired months earlier, so it verified every answer against an empty list;
* router calibration had no caller for `record_routing_feedback` anywhere, so
  `ENABLE_CALIBRATION` switched on a calibrator that never learns.
