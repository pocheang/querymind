"""The rate limits have to reach the routes they name.

Eight admin endpoints carried `@limiter.limit(...)` and none of them was limited.
The decorator came from a slowapi wrapper, slowapi was never a dependency -- not
in pyproject, not in the locks, not installed -- so the import guard fell through
to a no-op decorator every time. Creating an administrator, resetting a password
and resetting an approval token were unlimited, and the code said otherwise on
the line above each one.

The limits are rules in the middleware now, which is registered on the app, and
the failure mode moves with them: a rule whose pattern no longer matches any
route is silently no protection at all. So the first test asks the OpenAPI
document rather than trusting the patterns, and the second names the eight
operations explicitly, because "every rule matches something" would still pass if
a rule were deleted.
