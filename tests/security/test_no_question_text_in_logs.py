"""User questions must not be reproduced in logs.

Retrieval used to log the question itself at INFO on ordinary paths, so anyone
with log access read what every user asked. Truncating to the first 50
characters was no better -- it still reproduced the substance, and a question is
often the whole of what a user considers private about a session.

`question_ref` keeps the property the logs actually needed: the same question
yields the same handle, so a request stays followable across lines, without the
text. See P2-10 in
docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-29-user-data-isolation.md.
