"""Which documents an actor can see, stated one rule at a time.

`list_visible_document_rows` decides what every later stage is allowed to know
about: the access scope is built from its output, and `similarity_search` is
scoped by the source list it produces. Fifteen test files reference this module,
and every one of them replaces this function with a stub -- so the rules
themselves, tenant, ACL, ownership, visibility and the admin exception, ran
untested.

Pinned before the function was split up, but worth having either way: the
interesting cases here are the ones where a row is *not* visible, and a
refactor is not the only thing that can quietly turn one of those around.
