"""A user who has uploaded nothing must get an answer, not a 500.

Found by walking the app as a new user: register, log in, ask one question ->
`POST /api/advanced-rag/query` returned 500. The pipeline raised
`RetrievalFailureError` from the `knowledge` stage with "All 2 retrieval attempts
failed. Failed retrievers: bm25, vector."

Nothing had failed. `KnowledgeOrchestrator._retrieve_source` *skips* the
document-backed sources when the caller's document scope is empty -- which is the
documented behaviour, and the whole point of keeping "empty scope" and "missing
scope" distinct (CLAUDE.md, User Data Isolation). But it reports that skip as
`source_status = "skipped"`, and `RAGAgentService.retrieve` judged the run with
`value != "completed"`, so a deliberate skip and a thrown vector store were the
same thing.

The degradation policy asks how much of the retrieval this run *attempted* came
back. A source that was never attempted belongs in neither the numerator nor the
denominator.
