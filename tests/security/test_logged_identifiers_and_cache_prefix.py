"""The last three `pythonsecurity:S5145` sites, and what reading them found.

The rule says caller-controlled data reaches a logging call. Reading the three:

- `guard.py` logs `user_key` on two failure paths, and a third at debug. It is
  the caller's user id -- the one field that ties every other log line to a
  person, reproduced only on lines that exist to report a failure. `key_ref`
  keeps what those lines are for (are these failures one user or many?) and
  drops the rest, the same trade `question_ref` already makes for question text.

- `cache_manager.py` logs the `prefix` its caller asked to clear, and the
  interesting part is where that string came from: `POST /optimization/cache/clear`
  takes it as a query parameter and it reaches
  `scan_iter(match=f"{prefix}:*")`. So it was never only a log concern -- an
  unconstrained value there is a Redis glob, and `*` clears every namespace.
  Admin-only, and `clear()` with no parameter does the same thing on purpose, so
  this is not an escalation; it is a parameter that did not do what it said.

Both ends are checked, because they answer different questions: the HTTP
parameter so a bad value is a 422 rather than a surprise, and `CacheManager`
itself because that is where the glob is built and the class has callers other
than the endpoint.
