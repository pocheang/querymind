"""What the connector read tool may see, and what it may say.

Two separate properties, and the second is the less obvious one.

A `read_only` tool's summary is fed back into the *next* selection step as a
`ToolObservation` -- `ToolAgentService._observation` suppresses the text only for
`open_world` tools. `ConnectorView.name` is free text the user typed, up to 120
characters, so a summary composed from it would put user-authored prose where the
model reads its own working notes.

The summary is therefore built from `connector_id` (which matches
`^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}$`) and `status` (a two-value Literal) alone, and is
*structurally* incapable of carrying an instruction. That is what makes the
read-then-write composition ("list my integrations, then disable the stale one")
safe rather than merely untested -- so it is pinned here rather than left as a
habit, in the same spirit as test_tool_selection_is_evidence_blind.py.
