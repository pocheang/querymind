"""The resolved AccessScope must constrain retrieval, not just the output.

`privacy_permission` resolves the caller's identity into an AccessScope and puts
it in graph state under `permission_scope`. Retrieval, however, reads
`request.source_scope` -- whatever the caller handed in. The two agree today only
because the API layer computes the same visible-source list twice
(app/api/routes/public/query.py:67). Callers that do not, do not:
`app/api/routes/internal/pipeline_contract.py:63` forwards `allowed_sources=None`
and `app/api/routes/public/clarification.py:147` builds an empty RequestScope,
and both mean "search everything" once they reach the store.

The fix is for `privacy_permission` to rewrite `request.source_scope` from the
scope it just resolved, so retrieval cannot be handed a wider range than the
resolver authorized. See P0-1 step 4 in
docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-29-user-data-isolation.md.
