"""The evaluation baselines must return a result, not raise.

Both baselines built ``RetrievalResult(query_id=..., query=query, ...)`` while the
required field is ``query_text``, so pydantic raised for a missing field on every
query, for every baseline -- ``POST /api/evaluation/run`` and ``/compare`` could
not complete at all.

It survived because the mistake was made twice.  The happy path's ValidationError
was swallowed by a bare ``except Exception``, whose handler then re-made the
identical mistake *outside* the try, where nothing could catch it.  So the tests
here are parametrized over ``SUPPORTED_SYSTEMS`` rather than written once per
baseline: the defect was two call sites having to agree, and a third baseline
would have had to agree too.

Nothing on the request path imports this module, which is why nobody saw it.
