"""A follow-up question must not be retrieved on its pronoun.

`OrchestrationRequest.conversation` reached exactly two consumers -- the
synthesizer and the tool selector -- and neither of them retrieves. The router
saw only `request.question`, the Knowledge Agent used only `request.question` as
the retrieval query, and `build_rewrite_queries` took a query with no history.
So "它的成本呢？" ran a vector search on those five characters, and the
synthesizer then had to answer from evidence fetched for the wrong query. The
failure looked like poor retrieval rather than a missing resolution step.

The fix is the rewrite step the repository already had a slot for, given the one
argument it was missing. `app/services/context_management.py` implements the
older rule-based alternative (pronoun -> entity) and is deliberately *not* wired
here: it detects a follow-up by substring-matching a fixed pronoun list, and the
most common Chinese follow-up shape drops the subject entirely -- there is no
pronoun to match. It keeps its existing reader, the session export endpoint.
