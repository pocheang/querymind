"""An admin-editable field must not be read through a frozen Settings object.

CLAUDE.md makes an audited claim: `requires_restart` is False on every editable
field, because "each consumer either reads `get_settings()` per use, or is held
by an object `RAGPipeline` builds per request, or is rebuilt by the reload".

There is a third shape it does not cover. Six modules bind
`settings = get_settings()` at *module scope*. `get_settings` is `lru_cache`d and
a reload calls `cache_clear()`, which builds a **new** object -- so those modules
keep the one they captured at import, for the life of the process.

Nothing is broken today: none of the editable fields is read through one of them,
which is why this file asserts rather than ratchets. But the claim holds by
coincidence, not by construction. Adding a field to `config_schema.py` that
happens to be read in one of those modules would break it silently, and silently
is the whole problem: `POST /admin/config/values` would report success, the
console would show the new value, and the running process would keep the old one
until restart.

That failure mode is already documented once, for `CASCADE_*` and the module
global `_get_validation_cascade` caches. This is the same hazard reached from a
different direction, so it gets a guard rather than a paragraph.

Both sides are discovered, not listed: a seventh frozen module or a thirtieth
editable field is covered the day it is added.
