"""Configuration has one source, and it is `Settings`.

A value read with `os.getenv` is unreachable by the documented configuration
flow. `Settings` loads `.runtime/{APP_ENV}.env` through pydantic-settings, which
parses that file into the settings object **without exporting anything into the
process environment** -- so `make config-render` cannot set an `os.getenv` key,
and neither can a configuration centre pushing values into `Settings`. The only
way to set one is a real exported environment variable, present before the
module is imported.

That is how nine live switches ended up invisible to every configuration
surface, including `GET /api/advanced-rag/config`, which reported an
`ENABLE_QUERY_DECOMPOSITION` that nothing reads while the real switch
(`QUERY_DECOMPOSE_ENABLED`) defaulted to on. An admin page reporting something
other than the running configuration is worse than no page.

A direct `os.getenv` / `os.environ` read anywhere in `app/` must be in `ALLOWED`,
with a reason. The allowlist is keyed on `path::function` rather than a line
number: keying it on a line makes it fail on any edit *above* an exempt call,
which trains readers to re-point the entry instead of asking whether a real
escape appeared.

This began as a guard plus a ratchet, because `app/agents/shared/config.py`
reached the environment through four helper functions and the AST saw four call
sites rather than the 37 keys behind them. That block holds no environment reads
at all as of 2026-09-01 -- 20 of those constants had no reader anywhere and were
deleted, 13 became `Settings` fields, and the four scoring weights became plain
literals -- so the ratchet had nothing left to ratchet and went with it. A guard
that guards nothing is one more thing to read and no protection.
