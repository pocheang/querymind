"""`make up` has to actually start Neo4j, Redis and Chroma, reachable only on the development stack.

Two defects, both invisible until someone ran it.

`make up` was `docker compose up -d neo4j`, with no `-f`. There is no compose
file in the repository root, so it exited with "no configuration file provided"
-- a command documented in CLAUDE.md that could never have worked. The stack
lives under deploy/compose/, compose.yaml declares NEO4J_PASSWORD with `:?` so
it is mandatory, and the relative paths inside those files are written for
deploy/compose/ as the base directory.

And no service published a port. That is right for compose.yaml, which is the
production stack -- containers reach each other over the `querymind` network and
the backend uses `bolt://neo4j:7687`. But a locally run uvicorn is not on that
network: NEO4J_URI defaults to bolt://localhost:7687, so the graph route was
unreachable from the normal development loop and the Neo4j Browser could not be
opened at all.

The fix belongs in the dev overlay, and the tests below pin both halves: the
ports exist in development, and they still do not exist in production.
