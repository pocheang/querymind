"""A skipped chunk still occupies its position.

`split_documents_enhanced` was one function with three levels of nesting and a
cognitive complexity of 58 -- the highest in the project -- until 2026-09-06, when
it was split into `_split_document` / `_split_parent` / `_parent_id` /
`_neighbours`. The split was verified byte-for-byte against the old implementation
over a ten-document corpus, so these tests are not about that. They pin the two
properties that were hardest to see through the nesting and easiest to "tidy"
into a bug.

The first is that a blank chunk is *skipped but still counted*: `parent_index`,
`child_index` and the totals handed to `enhance_chunk_metadata` are positions in
the splitter's output, not in the kept subset. Renumbering them so they are
contiguous is the obvious-looking cleanup, and it silently changes what
"chunk 3 of 7" means to every consumer of that metadata.

The second is that `_neighbours` reads the *raw* neighbouring chunks while the
chunk being described is stripped. Those are different strings whenever a chunk
begins or ends on whitespace. Stripping both, for symmetry, would change the
context the metadata enhancer sees.
