"""A chunk from the middle of a section does not know which section it is in.

`SmartChunker` (`app/services/multimodal/smart_chunker.py`, deleted in the
commit that added this file) was 483 lines aimed at exactly that gap: it split a
PDF by heading into `Section`s and carried the heading onto every chunk it made.
Nothing in `app/` ever constructed it, so none of that ran.

It was deleted rather than connected because connecting it meant rewriting the
parts that do the work. It read PDFs only, through `fitz`, where the loader
handles many formats; it had no notion of the parent/child pair the retrieval
path expands through; its `DocumentChunk` is not the type the index takes; and
`_split_section` ended with

    # For simplicity, add all to first chunk
    chunks[0].tables = section.tables

which is the *same* defect CLAUDE.md already records against the live splitter
under Multimodal retrieval -- a 40-row table cut into seven chunks, only the
first of which carries the header row.

The idea was worth keeping and the implementation was not, so the gap was
recorded here as an executable claim rather than as a sentence in a plan. That
worked as designed: on 2026-09-06 the behaviour landed, the strict xfail turned
into an XPASS and failed the suite, and the marker came off -- the pattern
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-29-user-data-isolation.md` used for its eight.

What landed is deliberately smaller than SmartChunker was. Chunk boundaries are
unchanged; the splitter still cuts by size, and a heading is *carried* onto the
chunks that follow it rather than used to decide where to cut. Splitting by
section instead is a larger change with its own trade-offs, and this test does not
ask for it.

    Measured before this held -- one heading and forty sentences under it, which

    splits *at* the heading, which strands it in a chunk of its own with no body
    to support -- a retrievable item that answers nothing -- while the six chunks
    holding the answer carried no word saying what they are about.
