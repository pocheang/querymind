"""A triplet's confidence must say how it was produced.

`extract_graph_triplets` stamped `confidence=0.7, method="legacy"` on every
triplet regardless of extractor, so `filter_triplets(min_confidence=...)` could
not tell an LLM-extracted relation from a regex-chained one and its threshold was
inert.

That mattered because the rule extractor does not find relations. It takes the
ten most *frequent* `ENTITY_PATTERN` matches -- and that pattern matches any 2-12
character CJK run, so in Chinese it matches nearly every word -- then pairs them
by adjacent frequency rank, which is an artefact of sort order, and labels every
pair in a chunk with one relation keyed off the whole chunk's wording.

And it was the default path, not an edge case: `MODEL_BACKEND=local` is what a
fresh checkout runs, the offline stand-in cannot emit the required JSON array, so
`extract_triplets` fell through to rules on every chunk. The graph filled with
invented edges that the graph route then served as evidence.
