"""Clarification is an HTTP conversation, not a pipeline stage.

There was a `clarification` node between `router` and `planner`. It spent a
`route_timeout_ms` ceiling and one clarifier call on every question with missing
fields, and produced two state values -- `clarification` and `complete_query` --
that nothing in `app/` ever read.

It could not have done otherwise. The multi-round state lives in the session
store behind `POST /api/v1/clarification/check`, so a graph node has no collected
context to pass; the clarifier therefore always returned `action="ask"`, which
the node logged and ignored, continuing with the original question.

What must survive the removal is the *information*: `RouteDecision.clarification_fields`
still says what is missing, `RouterDecision.completeness` still reports it, and
the HTTP endpoint still owns the interaction. That is what these tests pin --
a deletion that quietly took the feature with the no-op would look identical
from the graph's side.
