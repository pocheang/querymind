"""A caller's deadline has to reach the budget -- and may only ever narrow it.

`OrchestrationRequest.deadline_at` was accepted, forwarded through
`PipelineRequest`, and read by nobody: a caller saying "stop at T" was silently
ignored while the run spent the full `STAGE_TIMEOUT_TOTAL_MS`.

The same wiring publishes the budget to `app.services.runtime.request_context`,
which the LLM query rewriter and the synthesizer's self-review and
fact-verification exits check on their own. Nothing on the request path had ever
set it, so `remaining_seconds()` returned None -- and `_llm_rewrite` reads None
as "no time left", which made `QUERY_REWRITE_WITH_LLM` a switch that could not
turn anything on.
