"""Pipeline stage events must land in the store the SSE endpoint reads.

Three independent breaks used to swallow them: RAGPipeline built the engine
without a publisher (so it fell back to NullEventPublisher), nothing but the
MCP registry ever wrote to ExecutionEventStore, and record_agent_step had no
callers. The net effect was that
GET /api/v1/orchestration/executions/{id}/events replayed exactly one
synthesized terminal event for an ordinary chat turn, so the frontend trace
panel had nothing to show.
