## Deployment Strategy

### Recommended Approach: Gradual Rollout

```
Phase 1: Canary (10% traffic) → 24-48 hours monitoring
Phase 2: Partial (50% traffic) → 24-48 hours monitoring  
Phase 3: Full (100% traffic) → Ongoing monitoring
```

### Alternative: Feature Flag

If gradual rollout infrastructure is not available, use a feature flag:

```python
# Environment variable or config flag
USE_ENHANCED_AGENTS = os.getenv("USE_ENHANCED_AGENTS", "false").lower() == "true"
```

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### Phase 1: Preparation (30 minutes)

1. **Update Environment**
```bash
conda activate rag-local
git pull origin main
git checkout v0.6.0  # Or use commit 48e3376
```

2. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
# Verify all dependencies are installed
conda env update -f environment.yml
```

3. **Verify Configuration**
```bash
# Check new configuration files exist
ls -la config/router_calibration.json
ls -la config/circuit_breaker.json
ls -la config/retry_policy.json
ls -la config/fact_verification.json
```

4. **Run Pre-Deployment Tests**
```bash
# Quick smoke test
pytest tests/agents/test_router_enhanced.py -v

# Validate golden dataset
python scripts/create_golden_dataset.py
```

### Phase 2: Canary Deployment (10% Traffic)

5. **Deploy to Canary Environment**
```bash
# Example for load balancer configuration
# Route 10% of traffic to new version

# If using feature flag approach:
export USE_ENHANCED_AGENTS=true
# Restart 10% of application servers
```

6. **Monitor Key Metrics (24-48 hours)**

Monitor these metrics closely:

**Quality Metrics**:
- Router accuracy (target: ≥98%)
- Retrieval precision (target: ≥0.93)
- Hallucination rate (target: ≤8%)
- Citation completeness (target: ≥95%)

**Performance Metrics**:
- Response time P95 (threshold: <3850ms)
- Response time P99 (threshold: <4025ms)
- Error rate (threshold: <1%)
- System availability

**User Experience**:
- User satisfaction scores
- Query success rate
- Escalation rate

7. **Validation Commands**
```bash
# Check router performance
python scripts/ab_comparison.py

# Check system performance
python scripts/load_test.py

# Monitor logs
tail -f logs/app.log | grep -i "error\|warn"
```

### Phase 3: Partial Deployment (50% Traffic)

8. **Expand to 50% Traffic**

If canary phase shows positive results:
- No increase in error rates
- Performance within acceptable range
- Quality metrics improved

```bash
# Increase traffic allocation to 50%
# Monitor for additional 24-48 hours
```

9. **Comparative Analysis**
```bash
# Compare old vs new version metrics
# Document any issues or observations
```

### Phase 4: Full Deployment (100% Traffic)

10. **Complete Rollout**

```bash
# Deploy to all production servers
# Set USE_ENHANCED_AGENTS=true globally if using feature flag
# Or route 100% traffic to new version
```

11. **Post-Deployment Verification**

```bash
# Verify all agents are using enhanced versions
# Check configuration is loaded correctly
# Monitor for any unexpected behavior
```

## Monitoring & Dashboards

### Key Metrics to Track

**Quality Dashboard**:
```sql
-- Router accuracy (daily)
SELECT DATE(created_at), 
       AVG(CASE WHEN route_correct THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as accuracy
FROM routing_decisions
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at);

-- Hallucination rate (daily)
SELECT DATE(created_at),
       AVG(CASE WHEN has_hallucination THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as hallucination_rate
FROM answer_validations  
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at);

-- Citation completeness (daily)
SELECT DATE(created_at),
       AVG(CASE WHEN citations_complete THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as completeness
FROM answer_validations
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at);
```

**Performance Dashboard**:
```sql
-- Response time percentiles (hourly)
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('hour', created_at) as hour,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.50) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY response_time_ms) as p50,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY response_time_ms) as p95,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.99) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY response_time_ms) as p99
FROM query_logs
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('hour', created_at);

-- Error rate (hourly)
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('hour', created_at) as hour,
    COUNT(*) as total_requests,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'error' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as errors,
    AVG(CASE WHEN status = 'error' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as error_rate
FROM query_logs
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('hour', created_at);
```

### Alert Thresholds

Set up alerts for:
- Error rate > 1% for 5 minutes
- P95 response time > 4000ms for 10 minutes
- Hallucination rate > 10% (hourly average)
- Router accuracy < 95% (hourly average)
- System availability < 99.5%

## Rollback Plan

### When to Rollback

Rollback immediately if:
- Error rate exceeds 2%
- P95 response time exceeds 4500ms
- Critical functionality broken
- Hallucination rate exceeds 15%
- System availability drops below 99%

### Rollback Procedure

1. **Quick Rollback (Feature Flag)**
```bash
# Set feature flag to false
export USE_ENHANCED_AGENTS=false

# Restart application servers
# OR toggle load balancer to route to old version
```

2. **Full Rollback (Git)**
```bash
# Revert to previous version
git checkout v0.5.0

# Restart services
conda activate rag-local
# Restart application
```

3. **Verify Rollback**
```bash
# Check that old version is running
# Monitor metrics to confirm stability
# Document rollback reason
```

4. **Post-Rollback Analysis**
```bash
# Investigate root cause
# Review logs and metrics
# Plan fixes before retry
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: High response times after deployment**
- Check circuit breaker activation
- Review retry policy configuration
- Monitor database query performance
- Verify fact verification threshold not too strict

**Issue: Increased hallucination rate**
- Check fact verification configuration
- Review citation completeness
- Verify NLI model is loaded correctly
- Check for timeout issues in validation pipeline

**Issue: Router accuracy degraded**
- Verify router_calibration.json is loaded
