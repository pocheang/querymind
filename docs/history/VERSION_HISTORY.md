## v0.7.0.2

**Release Date**: September 16, 2026  
**Type**: Patch / Quality & Security (SonarQube Quality Gate Mastery, Zero Duplication, Architecture Cleanliness)  
**Status**: Production Ready  

Public highlights:

- **SonarQube / SonarCloud Full Quality Gate Mastery**:
  - **100% Zero Vulnerabilities**: Resolved ReDoS vulnerabilities (`python:S5852`) in Markdown table regexes across ingestion parsers.
  - **100% Zero Bugs**: Fixed potential null pointer and structural bugs.
  - **100% Zero Code Smells**: Refactored 73+ cognitive complexity hotspots across frontend and backend modules to `<= 15`.
- **Complete Elimination of Code Duplication (100% Cleared, 0 lines / 0 blocks, 0.0% density)**:
  - Down from 571 duplicated lines / 31 blocks to **0 duplicated lines / 0 blocks**.
  - Frontend `DataFlowVisualization.tsx` topology refactored with compact definition tables and declarative edge generator.
  - Extracted 34 node translation pairs into `dataFlowTranslations.json`, eliminating AST token pattern repetition.
  - Reused Knowledge Graph formatting functions between `graph.py` and `enhanced_graph.py`.
  - Reused Docling Markdown page extraction in `pdf_loader_enhanced.py` from `pdf_loader.py`.
  - Consolidated Admin dashboard loading skeleton and error retry UI into `AdminDashboardStatus` in `AdminPrimitives.tsx`.

## v0.7.0.1

**Release Date**: September 14, 2026  
**Type**: Patch / Feature / Security (Table & Excel Ingestion, Table SQL, Rich Graph, Injection Screening)  
**Status**: Production Ready  

Public highlights:

- **Unified CSV & Tabular Document Ingestion**:
  - Registered `.csv` across backend limits (`app/api/deps/documents.py`, `app/api/routes/public/documents.py`) and frontend allowed file types (`frontend/src/lib/uploadFormats.ts`).
  - Added robust CSV loading in `app/ingestion/loaders/office_loader.py` with multi-encoding fallback (`utf-8-sig`, `utf-8`, `gb18030`, `gbk`, `latin-1`) and automatic delimiter detection (comma, semicolon, tab, pipe).
  - Generated first-class structured `TableBlock` records with `modality="table"` for direct multimodal vector storage.

- **Table-Aware Header-Preserving Chunking (Anti-Hallucination)**:
  - Eliminated column transposition and semantic loss during RAG retrieval when long spreadsheets or markdown tables are sliced across chunk boundaries.
  - Implemented `_is_markdown_table_content` and `_split_markdown_table_text` in `app/ingestion/chunking/splitter.py`.
  - Every sliced child chunk retains sheet context, column definitions (`| Col1 | Col2 |`), separator rows (`|---|---|`), and row range markers (e.g., `(Rows 16-30 of 60)`).

- **Excel Merged-Cell Forward-Fill & Table Ingestion Guardrails**:
  - Implemented `_extract_sheet_rows_with_merged_cells` in `app/ingestion/loaders/office_loader.py` to inspect `sheet.merged_cells.ranges` and automatically forward-fill top-left values across merged cells.
  - Subordinate rows retain their category and department context rather than becoming empty cells, preventing dimension loss during chunking and semantic search.
  - Added `MAX_TABLE_ROWS = 5000` guardrail with automatic markdown truncation indicators to protect against memory bloat on large workbooks.

- **Universal Non-Office `TableBlock` Extraction (PDF & Markdown)**:
  - Enabled automatic extraction of Markdown pipe tables in `app/ingestion/loaders/dispatch.py` for PDF and Markdown files.
  - Generates structured `TableBlock` instances with globally unique deterministic IDs across document pages, populating `ParsedDocument.tables`.
  - Ensures tables in PDF and Markdown files are indexed into ChromaDB's dedicated `table_summaries` collection.

- **Tabular & Spreadsheet Business Query Routing Expansion**:
  - Expanded `_VISUAL_QUERY_PATTERN` in `app/agents/knowledge/service.py` with comprehensive business vocabulary (`excel`, `csv`, `xlsx`, `tsv`, `spreadsheet`, `sheet`, `报表`, `明细`, `清单`, `台账`, `账单`, `数据表`).
  - Ensures natural language questions referencing spreadsheets and financial/sales ledgers reliably route to multimodal table retrieval.

- **Nested & Irregular Table Normalization Bugfix**:
  - Rewrote `detect_nested_table` and `flatten_nested_table` in `app/ingestion/extraction/tables_nested.py`, eliminating dead code where string splitting previously made pipe count checks impossible.
  - Added HTML table cell stripping and negative lookbehind regex `(?<!\\)\|` to safely preserve escaped pipes within cells without fracturing table structures.

- **Multi-Sheet Context Enrichment & DOCX Extraction**:
  - Enhanced `_rows_to_markdown` in `app/ingestion/loaders/office_loader.py` with explicit `### Sheet: {sheet_name}` demarcation for multi-sheet workbooks.
  - Added `extract_markdown_tables` to parse embedded pipe tables from Word `.docx` documents into structured `TableBlock` instances.
  - Updated `TableExtractor` (`app/services/multimodal/table_extractor.py`) and ingestion pipeline (`app/services/documents/ingest.py`) with column schema lists, total row counts, and sheet metadata.

- **Automated Verification & Real-World Enterprise Scenario Suite**:
  - Added `tests/ingestion/test_real_world_tables.py` (multi-sheet merged Excel, Chinese procurement CSV ledger, markdown infrastructure table, 7 natural language query routing scenarios).
  - Added `tests/ingestion/test_table_enhancements.py` (routing pattern, nested table flatten, markdown table extraction, merged-cell extraction, max row truncation).
  - Maintained full regression coverage across `test_table_excel_ingest.py`, `test_upload_formats_agree.py`, and `test_multimodal_indexing.py`.

- **Table SQL Analytics, Rich Graph, Web Search & Injection Screening**:
  - Owner-scoped `querymind_table_query` tool over DuckDB (external access disabled) with a SQLite fallback.
  - Typed graph entities with per-source descriptions and community summaries; `POST /admin/graph-rag/communities/build`.
  - Pluggable web-search providers (`duckduckgo`, `tavily`, `bing`, `searxng`) and a composer web-search toggle.
  - Prompt-injection screening with nonce-sandboxed prompts, canary tokens and output egress checks.

- **Pre-merge Review (2026-09-14)**: fourteen defects fixed before release, four of them isolation failures -- cross-user table reads, DuckDB file access, cross-tenant community summaries and graph descriptions. Security defaults (`AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE`, `AUTH_COOKIE_SAMESITE`, `AUTH_EXPOSE_TOKEN_IN_RESPONSE`) restored; the injection detector no longer blocks ordinary questions.
  - Upgrade note: graphs written by a pre-release build need a reingest or `POST /admin/graph-rag/communities/build`.
  - SonarCloud: quality gate green; ten super-linear regular expressions over document text rewritten and pinned against their previous forms.
  - Verification: backend 1,991 passed, frontend 154 passed, 0 failures.
