# Release Notes - v0.4.2

**Release Date**: 2026-05-22
**Release Type**: Hardening & Hygiene Release
**Focus**: Repository hygiene, observability, security guards, dependency slimming

## 🎯 Overview

Version 0.4.2 is a focused hardening pass on the v0.4.1 codebase. It does
not add user-facing features. Instead it removes dead code, restores
observability on silently-swallowed errors, modernizes the FastAPI
lifecycle, simplifies a duplicated dependency-injection pattern,
introduces a production-mode CORS guard with a structured admin audit
trail, and splits heavy ML/OCR dependencies into optional extras so
minimum installs are dramatically smaller.

**Net change across five focused commits: 18 files, +471 / −742 lines
(net −271).**

All changes are intended to be behavior-preserving for development and
default deployments. The single behavioral change ships with explicit
opt-in via `APP_ENV` and is covered by new unit tests.

## ✨ What Changed

### 1. Repository hygiene (`ffe46a3`)

- **Deleted `app/api/routes/admin_users.py.backup`** — 375 lines of an
  accidentally committed scratch file containing the same opening
  docstring repeated hundreds of times. It was tracked in git but was
  not imported anywhere.
- **Deleted `app/services/auth.py`** — 135 lines of dead code shadowed
  by the `app/services/auth/` subpackage. Verified at runtime that
  `from app.services.auth import AuthService` resolves to
  `app.services.auth.legacy_service.AuthService`; the standalone module
  file was never loaded.
- **Tooling config moved into `pyproject.toml`** — `pytest.ini` and
  `.coveragerc` deleted; their settings live under
  `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` / `[tool.coverage.*]`. Pytest now reports
  `configfile: pyproject.toml`.
- **Added `[tool.ruff]`** with `target-version = "py311"` and a
  conservative starter rule set (E, F, W, I, B, UP) plus per-file
  ignores for the CLI-style `print` blocks in
  `app/services/agent_document_filter.py` and
  `app/evaluation/service.py`.
- **`pyproject.toml`: bumped version 0.3.3 → 0.4.1** to match `VERSION`,
  README, and the v0.4.1 changelog entry.
- **Optional extras introduced** for the heavy ML/OCR stacks (see
  commit 5 for the full layout — the actual TOML changes ship in this
  commit).
- **`.gitignore`: added `.ruff_cache/` and `coverage.xml`.**

Behavior change: none.

### 2. FastAPI lifespan + observability (`6d9d6b0`)

- **`@app.on_event("startup"/"shutdown")` → `lifespan` async context
  manager.** The old decorator pair has been deprecated in modern
  FastAPI versions. The auto-ingest watcher and shadow_queue start/stop
  semantics are unchanged.
- **`_ROUTE_MODULES` tuple was missing five recently added routers**
  (`admin_language_stats`, `agent_tracking`, `evaluation`,
  `advanced_rag`, `analytics`). Without them, monkeypatches on
  `app.api.main.*` would silently fail to propagate to those modules.
  The tuple is now complete and the `_CompatMainModule` docstring
  explains the rule for future contributors.
- **`datetime.utcnow()` → `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`** in
  `admin_token_tracker.py` (3 call sites). A small `_utcnow()` helper
  preserves the existing naive-datetime storage so comparisons keep
  working.
- **Observability for previously silent failures**: nine
  `except Exception: pass` blocks now log `logger.warning(...,
  exc_info=True)` so operators can see Redis / vector store / Neo4j
  flakiness in logs instead of staring at silent degradation.
  Touched files:
  - `app/services/query_result_cache.py` — 7 spots (get/set, inflight
    lock/clear/check, stream append/done)
  - `app/services/query_guard.py` — 2 spots (waiting_decr,
    inflight_decr)
  - `app/services/ingest_service.py` — vector store
    `delete_collection`, Neo4j client init
  - `app/retrievers/vector_store.py` — `reset_vector_store_from_records`
  - `app/ingestion/graph_extractor.py` — LLM triplet fallback
  - `app/ingestion/utils/ocr_utils.py` — OCR upscale variant build
    (kept at `debug` level — low-impact fallback)

Behavior change: none. Exceptions still recover the same way; they are
now visible.

### 3. Dependency-injection simplification (`629cb29`)

The previous pattern in `app/api/dependencies.py` declared each helper
in three places: an alias import, a `_xxx_wrapper` function with an
in-body lazy import, and a final shadowing assignment
`_xxx = _xxx_wrapper`.

After this commit each helper is declared once. The pattern is:

```python
# top of file
from app.api.utils.query_helpers import _query_cache_key as _query_cache_key_impl

# later, near the related state
def _query_cache_key(...) -> str:
    return _query_cache_key_impl(..., index_fingerprint_fn=..., model_fingerprint_fn=...)
```

Ten helpers were collapsed: `_query_cache_key`, `_run_with_query_runtime`,
`_is_overload_mode`, `_launch_shadow_run`,
`_effective_strategy_for_session`, `_build_memory_context_for_session`,
`_enforce_result_source_scope`, `_runtime_diagnostics_summary`,
`_user_api_settings_for_runtime`, `_query_model_fingerprint_for_user`.

Behavior change: none. Verified that all ten callables still resolve
and that auth / admin / readiness / memory test suites pass unchanged.

### 4. Production CORS guard + structured admin audit (`a4c5791`)

**CORS production hardening.** Module-level CORS setup has been
extracted into `_configure_cors(app, settings)`. When `APP_ENV` is
`prod` or `production` (case-insensitive) and `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS`
includes `*`, the backend now refuses to start with a `RuntimeError`
that points the operator at the fix. Dev / staging behavior is
unchanged — `*` is still tolerated and credentials are still disabled
when the origin list is `*`.

Five new unit tests in `tests/test_cors_prod_guard.py` cover the matrix:
wildcard allowed in dev, rejected for both `prod` and `production`
aliases, explicit allowlist accepted in production, CORS-disabled
bypass.

**Admin audit details: JSON instead of `; `-joined strings.** A
`_audit_detail(**fields)` helper in `admin_users.py` renders detail as
`json.dumps(..., ensure_ascii=False, sort_keys=True)`. None / empty
strings normalize to JSON `null`. Three admin endpoints now use it:
`create_admin`, `reset_password`, `reset_approval_token`. Previously a
user-supplied `reason` containing `;` could break naive `; `-based
parsing; the JSON form is round-trippable via `json.loads`.

While converting these call sites, a latent **NameError on the same
three endpoints** was fixed: the call to
`validate_and_check_approval_token()` returns `tuple[bool, str]`, but
the result was being discarded while the next f-string referenced
`token_mode`. The bug never fired in practice because the only tests
covering this path mock the validator. Capturing the tuple is required
for the audit detail to render correctly.

Behavior change: production startup is stricter; everything else is
equivalent.

### 5. Optional extras for heavy ML/OCR stacks (`ceb2810`)

Five heavyweight dependencies moved out of the core install set into
named extras. **Core dependencies dropped from 34 to 29.** A minimum
install no longer pulls torch, CUDA, Paddle, or Docling — roughly
2 GB+ of downloads avoided.

| Extra | Packages | Adds |
|-------|----------|------|
| `ocr` | `pytesseract` | Tesseract bindings (host binary required) |
| `paddle` | `paddlepaddle`, `paddleocr` | Layout-aware OCR (~500MB) |
| `docling` | `docling` | Structured PDF / DOCX / PPTX parsing |
| `reranker` | `sentence-transformers` | Cross-encoder reranking |
| `full` | meta-extra | Equivalent to the historical full install |

The application code already imports each of these lazily and falls
back gracefully when missing, which was confirmed by an
import-blocking smoke test:

- Reranker → falls back to lexical scoring
- Docling loaders → return `[]` and log a warning
- pytesseract OCR → emits a `Document` with
  `metadata.ocr_status = "pytesseract_missing"`
- paddleocr → `_try_paddleocr` returns `(None, metadata)`

`README.md` was updated with an **Optional extras** install block.

Behavior change: none for users running the historical full install
(`pip install -e .[full]` is equivalent to the previous default).
Minimum installs now degrade gracefully on the missing-feature paths
instead of failing at import.

## 🔍 Verification

All commits pass these checks:

- Static checks (`getDiagnostics`) — no new errors introduced
- `tomllib.load(open("pyproject.toml", "rb"))` parses cleanly; pytest
  reports `configfile: pyproject.toml`
- Targeted regression suites pass:
  - `tests/test_admin_security.py` (14 tests)
  - `tests/test_admin_user_provisioning.py` (9 tests)
  - `tests/test_admin_ops_api.py`
  - `tests/test_resilience.py`
  - `tests/test_auth_service.py`, `tests/test_auth_db_service.py`
  - `tests/test_readiness_api.py`, `tests/test_memory_api.py`,
    `tests/test_api_rag_scope.py`
  - `tests/test_security_hardening.py`
  - `tests/test_cors_prod_guard.py` (5 new tests, all pass)
- Import-blocking smoke verified all four optional-dependency fallback
  paths

Two pre-existing test failures remain unchanged by this work:

- `tests/test_security_fixes_v0_3_1_2.py::test_login_error_message_unified`
  — expected `"Invalid credentials"`, actual
  `"invalid credentials"`. Failed before this work and after.
- `tests/test_security_hardening.py::test_upload_rejects_too_many_files`
  — same situation.

These were confirmed via `git stash` to be independent of any change in
this release.

## 🔧 Migration Notes

**For most users — no action required.**

**If your `.env` sets `APP_ENV=prod` (or `production`) and your
`CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` is `*`:** the backend will refuse to start.
Update `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` to a comma-separated list of your trusted
frontend origins (https URLs).

**If you parse audit log `detail` fields:** the three admin endpoints
listed in commit 4 now emit JSON instead of `key=value; key=value`.
Update parsers to `json.loads(detail)`. Other audit detail strings are
unchanged.

**If you previously relied on the heavyweight default install:** add
the `[full]` extra:

```bash
pip install -e ".[full]"
```

This is equivalent to the v0.4.1 default behavior. Or pick a smaller
subset:

```bash
pip install -e ".[ocr]"        # just Tesseract
pip install -e ".[reranker]"   # just the cross-encoder
pip install -e ".[docling]"    # just structured PDF parsing
```

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

This release surfaced multiple latent issues during refactoring:

- The `_CompatMainModule` shim was missing five route modules — would
  have silently broken future tests that monkeypatched
  `app.api.main.*`.
- Three admin endpoints had a latent `NameError` (`token_mode`
  referenced before assignment) that was masked by mock-based tests.
- `app/services/auth.py` was 135 lines of code Python had been
  ignoring (shadowed by the same-named subpackage).

These are now fixed.
