# rebuilt in six months installs what this one did. `pip install --upgrade pip`
# used to lead this and was removed with the same reasoning -- an unpinned
# upgrade is the floating dependency this file is trying to stop having, and the
# image tag already fixes pip's version.
#
# The application itself is not installed. It used to be, as `pip install -e .`,
# which worked only because both stages happen to use WORKDIR /app -- the
# editable path hook baked into the builder's site-packages pointed at a
# directory the production stage refills with `COPY app ./app`. The code is
# copied in either way, so PYTHONPATH below says what that was relying on.

# chunks, docs, sessions, uploads, app.db, history.db, sessions_cold),
# `logs/`, and `.runtime/` for the snapshot the configuration centre writes
# after a successful fetch. Application code stays read-only to the process,
# which is most of the value of not being root.
