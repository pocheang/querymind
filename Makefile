# `docker compose up -d neo4j` on its own could never work: there is no compose
# file in the repository root, so it exited with "no configuration file
# provided". The stack lives under deploy/compose/, compose.yaml requires
# NEO4J_PASSWORD (declared with :? so it is mandatory), and the dev overlay is
# what publishes 7474/7687 to 127.0.0.1 -- a locally run uvicorn is not on the
# compose network, so without it NEO4J_URI's bolt://localhost:7687 reaches
# nothing. Mirrors how deploy/scripts/deploy.sh invokes compose.
# No --project-directory: compose then resolves the files' relative paths
# against deploy/compose/, which is what `env_file: ../../.runtime/...` and the
# `../../app` bind mounts are written for. Passing the repo root instead sent
# both two levels too high (verified: it looked for .runtime/ beside the repo).
# RUNTIME_ENV_FILE overrides that env_file default, which points at
# production.env -- absent on a development checkout.

# Retrieval quality over the corpus that ships in config/eval/. BM25 only, so it
