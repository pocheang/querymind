## [0.2.5] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- **[P0] Hybrid routing concurrent execution error**: Graph queries no longer execute twice in hybrid mode, reducing latency by 100-500ms.
- **[P1] Router decision vs adaptive planner conflict**: Router agent decisions are now preserved; adaptive planner only upgrades complexity when necessary (no downgrades).
- **[P1] Evidence sufficiency circular dependency**: Cleaned up routing logic to avoid duplicate hybrid evidence checks in `route_after_vector` and `route_after_graph`.
- **[P1] Query rewrite variant deduplication**: Duplicate query variants are now removed, reducing redundant LLM API calls by 10-30%.
- **[P1] Query rewrite LLM timeout control**: Added 2-second timeout and deadline checks to prevent LLM rewrite from blocking retrieval pipeline.
- **[P1] State access parameter validation**: Added validation for required `question` parameter in `run_query` with clear error messages.
- **[P2] Parent-child deduplication score preservation**: All score fields (hybrid_score, dense_score, bm25_score, rerank_score, rank_feature_score) are now preserved during deduplication.
- **[P2] Smalltalk fast-path state inconsistency**: Added `fast_path` flag to distinguish smalltalk from retrieval failures.
- **[P2] Web fallback semantic confusion**: Renamed to "allow fallback" for clarity; web research is conditional, not guaranteed.

- **[P2] Reranker fallback score normalization**: Fallback scores are now normalized to [0,1] range for consistency.
- **[P2] Citation sentence splitting improvement**: Enhanced sentence boundary detection to handle abbreviations and quotes correctly.
- **[P2] Web domain allowlist semantic clarity**: Allowlist now acts as strict whitelist; empty allowlist uses TLD-based trust scoring.
- **[P2] Graph signal score calculation optimization**: Changed from max to weighted average for more balanced scoring.
- **[P2] TTLCache concurrent performance optimization**: Implemented lazy cleanup strategy to reduce lock contention.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- Query-to-answer UX speed optimization framework with tiered execution policy (fast/balanced/deep tiers).
- `TierClassifier` module for intelligent query complexity classification based on query characteristics, session context, and system load.
- `LatencyBudgetManager` for enforcing hard runtime limits per tier (retrieval timeout, synthesis token limits, retry attempts).
- Tier-aware retrieval executor with budget enforcement and conditional web fallback triggers.
- Enhanced synthesis agent with tier-aligned answer framing (fast: conclusion-first, balanced: evidence + uncertainty, deep: complete narrative).
- UX telemetry system for tracking first token latency (P50/P95/P99), tier distribution, tier confidence, and citation coverage per tier.
- Load-based automatic tier degradation (>80% load → downgrade one tier, >95% load → force fast tier).
- Frontend tier display with visual indicators (fast=green, balanced=blue, deep=purple) and expected latency ranges.
- Response headers for tier metadata (`X-Query-Tier`, `X-Tier-Confidence`) for backward-compatible tier awareness.

### Fixed
- Tier classifier failure now falls back to balanced tier with explicit `tier_fallback=classifier_error` flag.
- Streaming interruption recovery now auto-falls back to non-stream completion without duplicate answer artifacts.
- Web fallback timeout no longer blocks main answer delivery; returns local-evidence answer with supplementation incomplete marker.
