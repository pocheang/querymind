## [0.4.2] - 2026-05-22

### 🛡️ Hardening & Hygiene Release

This release is a focused hardening pass on v0.4.1. No user-facing
features. **Net change: 18 files, +471 / −742 lines (net −271).**
Five focused, independently reviewable commits.

See [docs/releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.4.2.md](./docs/releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.4.2.md)
for the full breakdown.

#### Removed

- `app/api/routes/admin_users.py.backup` (375 lines of accidentally
  committed scratch text).
- `app/services/auth.py` (135 lines of dead code shadowed by the
  `app/services/auth/` subpackage; verified at runtime never to load).
- `pytest.ini` and `.coveragerc` (settings consolidated into
  `pyproject.toml`).
- The `_xxx_wrapper` indirection pattern in `app/api/dependencies.py`:
  10 helpers collapsed from three declarations each to one.

#### Changed

- **FastAPI lifecycle**: `@app.on_event("startup"/"shutdown")` →
  `lifespan` async context manager.
- **`_ROUTE_MODULES` tuple now includes** five recently added route
  modules (`admin_language_stats`, `agent_tracking`, `evaluation`,
  `advanced_rag`, `analytics`), preventing silent monkeypatch
  failures.
- **9 silent-failure paths now log warnings** (Redis cache get/set,
  inflight lock/clear/check, stream replay, vector store collection
  reset, Neo4j client init, LLM triplet fallback, OCR upscale).
- **`datetime.utcnow()` → `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`** in
  `admin_token_tracker.py` (Python 3.12+ compatibility).
- **Heavy ML/OCR stacks moved to optional extras** (`[ocr]`,
  `[paddle]`, `[docling]`, `[reranker]`, `[full]`). Core install is
  now ~2GB lighter.
- **`pyproject.toml` consolidates** tooling config:
  `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`, `[tool.coverage.*]`, `[tool.ruff]`.

#### Added

- **`_configure_cors(app, settings)`** with production wildcard
  refusal: when `APP_ENV` is `prod` / `production` and
  `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` includes `*`, startup fails with a clear error.
- **`_audit_detail(**fields)`** helper in `admin_users.py`: admin
  audit details for `create_admin`, `reset_password`,
  `reset_approval_token` are now JSON-serialized so user-supplied
  `reason` values cannot break parsing.
- **`tests/test_cors_prod_guard.py`** (5 unit tests) for the CORS
  production guard.
- **README "Optional extras" install block** documenting each extra.

#### Fixed

- **Latent `NameError` on three admin endpoints**: the call to
  `validate_and_check_approval_token()` returns `tuple[bool, str]`
  but the result was being discarded while the next f-string
  referenced `token_mode`. Now captures the tuple. The bug never
  fired in practice because all covering tests mock the validator.

#### Migration

| If you... | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Run with default config | Nothing required |
| Have `APP_ENV=prod` and `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS=*` | Replace `*` with explicit https origins |
| Parse audit `detail` for admin endpoints | Switch to `json.loads(detail)` |
| Need OCR / reranker / Docling | Install with `pip install -e ".[full]"` or pick a subset |
